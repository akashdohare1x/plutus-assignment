Description of a task:

You have an object:  
const testObj = {
first: 4,
second: 3,
third: 2,
fourth: 1
}

1 - You need to write a function stringify.
which will stringify the keys of the given object
into a camelcase string.
to test:
console.log(stringify(testObj));  
**Output: firstSecondThirdFourth**

2 - you need to write a function stringifyBackward.
this function will stringify the keys of given object backwards
into a camelcase string.

to test:
console.log(stringigyBackward(testObj));  
**Output: htruofDrihtDnocesTsrif**

3 - write your own implementation of ID and Either monad.
the implementation should comply with 3 monads laws.

4 - Implement RSA or Eliptic Curve algorythm
as a result you should get 3 functions

- generateKeys
- encrypt
- decrypt

5 - cover your test task with unit tests using jest

6 - put your solution into the repository

7 - (optional) write a github workflow to run unit tests on main branch commit.
